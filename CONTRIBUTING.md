# Contributing to AtB Community

There are many ways to contribute to AtB and AtB's projects. All projects that
can be open are by default open, but there are other ways of contributing than
just code. See [document on how Open Source is organized](./GOVERNANCE.md) to
get more details.

This document tries to cover different ways to contribute to the project, both
technical and non-technical. The goal of this document (and linked documents) is
to encourage new and existing contributors and make it as simple as possible to
get started or get the answers you need. Another goal is to be as transparent as
possible with development.

## Open Development

All work that can be open is open on the
[AtB GitHub Organization](https://github.com/AtB-AS). Everyone can contribute in
different ways (see [vocabulary](./GOVERNANCE.md#vocabulary)) and all follow the
same [review process](#review-process-and-pull-requests).

## Proposals and RFCs

New proposals of all types (technical, design, user experience) can be made by
everyone and follows the structure as specified in the
[RFC readme](./rfc/README.md).

## Review process and Pull Requests

We follow Pull Requests and review process. Changes should not be committed
directly to master, but in a separate branch (or fork) and proposed as a change
through Github Pull Requests. When adding PRs we require at least one
`committer` (see governance) to approve it.
