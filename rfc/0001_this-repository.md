# Implemented governance and work structure

### Goals

- Establish a defined open work process that is well documented
- Have an efficient way of working that is also transparent
- Have structure in decision processes

### Non-goals

- Have a lot of ceremonies and administrative overhead
- Be too rigid
- Have all the details mapped out from the beginning

## Summary

This proposes an implementation of the proposed Governance model (meritocratic
lightâ„¢) and a way to move RFC/DesignDocs over to open platform. With this
implementation on Github, we also get a way of doing formal decisions and
trackable discussions over time for historic contexts.

This solution is just the initial foundation and we should build on top of this
continuously as we find our way.

## Motivation

To have an open model with well-defined vocabulary that is understandable for
everyone and encourage internal contributors to be open. It should also motivate
non-internals to be contributors.

## Discussion

We have established that we should be Open Source. This comes with some sort of
formalism. To be a successful Open Source project we need established open
practices that are communicated openly and transparently. The author has
previously proposed an Open Source strategy and Governance model (not yet on
this repository). This is just a proposal on the implementation of the actual
decisions.
