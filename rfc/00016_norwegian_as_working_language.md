# Norwegian as working language

### Goals

- Allow for better cooperation with entire AtB org
- Closer ownership of backlogs for product owners

## Summary

Use Norwegian as language for almost everything but code and code related texts

## Discussion

When starting this project we valued using English as a working language for communication on Github, User Stories, Features, etc. This to be more accessible for other contributors and for collaboration with other entities within the same domain.

But now, seeing the reality of communication and discussions on issues here and having to translate potential tasks from Miro/Figma/Roadmaps here I think it's time to re-evaluate the initial assumption.

So this proposes a new working language: Norwegian. I don't think everything should be in Norwegian, though. See overview below. I also think we shouldn't rewrite feature descriptions or titles (only those where it might be appropriate).

## In Norwegian:

- Issues, Features, and tasks.
- Comments, QA, code reviews, and suggestions.
- Roadmap descriptions etc.
- Release text descriptions.

## In English:

- Code (variables etc) and code comments.
- Commit messages.
- Pull Request Titles (will be reused for changelog)
- Technical documentation (getting started, contribution guide, etc).
